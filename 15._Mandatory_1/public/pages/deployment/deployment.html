    <h5>Deployment with Vercel</h5>
    <p>One way to deploy a node.js application is using <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and with this it's easy
        to setup.</p>
    <p>
        The first thing we have to do is create a repository with our project on Github.
        If you are completely new to Vercel, the guide here will start from the beginning.
    </p>

    <h5>The vercel.json file.</h5>
    <p>
        The first thing we need to do after creating the Github repository is to create a vercel.json file. We will
        insert what is shown in the image below and push it to Github. Remeber if you have several projects in your
        repository and only want to deploy one of them you have to insert the vercel file in that folder (where you
        app.js is).
    </p>

    <p>
        The source where we got it from is here
        <a href="https://shadowsmith.com/guides/how-to-deploy-an-express-api-to-vercel#4-add-verceljson-configuration">How
            to deploy an Express API to Vercel - 4. Add vercel.json configuration</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vercel.json file is not completely the same at the source we have changed "src" and "dest" to "app.js"
        because we are using "app.js" and not the default "index.js".
    </p>

    <h5>Guide through vercel website.</h5>

    <p>
        Once we have made the repository on Github and created the vercel file, we can go to the Vercel website. As
        shown below what the site should look like, we gonna click on "Start Deploying".
    </p>
    <img class="img-fluid img-container mx-auto d-block" src="/pages/deployment/images/vercel1.png">

    <p class="mt-5">
        Now we have to login and we are gonna continue with Github. Then we are gonne Authorize Vercel.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <img class="col img-container mx-auto d-block" src="/pages/deployment/images/vercel2github.png">
        <img class="col img-container mx-auto d-block" src="/pages/deployment/images/vercel2githubPermission.png">
    </div>
    
    <div class="row mt-4">
        <div class="col">
            <p class="mt-2">
                When we have Authorize Vercel we can now import our repository from Github.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <img class="img-container d-block" src="/pages/deployment/images/vercel3import.png">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-5">
        Now we can configure our project and we only need to do 2 things here.
    </p>

    <div class="row mt-4">
        <div class="col">
            <p class="mt-2">
                First is optional and that is the "Project Name" if you just want it to be the same as the repository name, then
                go to the next thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second thing is the "Root Directory" this is important if you have a repository where you have several projects
                then you have to direct it to which one you want and also where you have the vercel file.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <img class="img-fluid img-container d-block" src="/pages/deployment/images/vercel4.png">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row mt-4">
        <div class="col">
            <p class="mt-2">
                If you have several project and only what one of your project
                you can click edit and then you can direct to the right folder then continue.
                But if you don't just click deploy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <img class="img-fluid img-container d-block" src="/pages/deployment/images/vercel4edit.png">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Now you can click deploy. It should also now be able to update every time you deploy to you Github repository.
        So try make a change and push it to your repository.
    </p>
