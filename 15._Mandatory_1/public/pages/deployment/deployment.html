    <h5>Deployment with Vercel</h5>
    <p>One way to deploy a node.js application is using <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and with this it's easy
        to setup.</p>
    <p>
        The first thing we have to do is create a repository with our project on Github.
        If you are completely new to Vercel, the guide here will start from the beginning.
    </p>

    <h5>The vercel.json file.</h5>
    <p>
        After creating the Github repository, the first thing we need to do is create a vercel.json file. We will insert
        the code shown in the image below and push it to Github. Remember, if you have several projects in your
        repository and only want to deploy one of them, you have to insert the vercel file in that folder (where your
        app.js is located).
    </p>

    <p>
        The source where we got it from is here
        <a href="https://shadowsmith.com/guides/how-to-deploy-an-express-api-to-vercel#4-add-verceljson-configuration">How
            to deploy an Express API to Vercel - 4. Add vercel.json configuration</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vercel.json file is not completely the same at the source we have changed "src" and "dest" to "app.js"
        because we are using "app.js" and not the default "index.js".
    </p>

    <h5>Guide through vercel website.</h5>

    <p>
        Once we have created the repository on Github and the Vercel file, we can navigate to the Vercel website. The
        screenshot below shows what the site should look like. We need to click on "Start Deploying".
    </p>

    <p class="mt-5">
        Now we need to login and continue with Github. Then we'll authorize Vercel.
    </p>

            <p class="mt-2">
                When we have authorize Vercel, we can now import our repository from Github.

    <p class="mt-5">
        Now we can configure our project and we only need to do 2 things here.

            <p class="mt-2">
                The first is optional, and that is the "Project Name." If you want it to be the same as the repository
                name, you can skip it and move to the next step.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second thing is the "Root Directory." This is important if you have a repository with several
                projects. You need to specify which one you want to use and where you have the Vercel file.
            </p>

        <div class="col">

                If you have several projects and only want to deploy one of them, you can click on "edit" and then
                direct it to the right folder. Then, continue.
                But if you don't, just click on "deploy".
            </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        Now you can click deploy. It should also now be able to update every time you deploy to you Github repository.
        So try make a change and push it to your repository.
