        <h3>What is NodeJS</h3>
        <p>
            Node.js is an interpreter of JavaScript that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser
            environment. It is based on the Chromium V8 engine and provides a runtime environment that enables
            JavaScript to be executed on a server. This means that developers can use JavaScript for both client-side
            and server-side programming without needing to learn another language. Node.js is widely used for
            server-side programming, powering many popular web applications and websites.

        <h3>What is npm</h3>
        <p>
            npm stands for Node Package Manager and it's a tool that comes bundled with Node.js and is used to
            manage
            third-party packages that can be used in your Node.js project.
            Node package manager is similar to Java's Maven build tool.

        <ul class="px-5">
            <li>npm allows you to easily install, update, and remove packages from your project, as well as manage
                their
                dependencies.</li>
            <li>npm uses a file called package.json to store information about your project, including its
                dependencies,
                scripts, and metadata.</li>
            <li>npm allows you to run scripts defined in the package.json file using the npm run command, which can
                be
                used
                to automate common tasks such as testing and building your project.</li>

        <h3>Package</h3>
        <p>
            The "package.json" is a configuration file in Node.js that contains information about your project such as its
            name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It is used by Node.js to manage your project's dependencies and to
            execute scripts. You can use it to install dependencies required by your project with the npm install
            command and to define custom scripts with the npm run command. The package.json file also allows you to
            specify the entry point of your application, set environment variables, and define other metadata related to
            your project.

        <p>
            When we install express in simple project wether it's manually or commnad like.
            When using command "npm i express" the package.json example look like below.
            If manually this way we create file called package.json and initialize it as json, by adding {} to the
            document, then add dependencies like the image below and then use command "npm i".
