                <p>
                    Node.js is an interpreter of JavaScript that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a
                    browser
                    environment. It is based on the Chromium V8 engine and provides a runtime environment that enables
                    JavaScript to be executed on a server. This means that developers can use JavaScript for both
                    client-side
                    and server-side programming without needing to learn another language. Node.js is widely used for
                    server-side programming, powering many popular web applications and websites.

                <p>
                    npm stands for Node Package Manager and it's a tool that comes bundled with Node.js and is used to
                    manage
                    third-party packages that can be used in your Node.js project.
                    Node package manager is similar to Java's Maven build tool.

                <ul class="px-5">
                    <li>npm allows you to easily install, update, and remove packages from your project, as well as
                        manage
                        their
                        dependencies.</li>
                    <li>npm uses a file called package.json to store information about your project, including its
                        dependencies,
                        scripts, and metadata.</li>
                    <li>npm allows you to run scripts defined in the package.json file using the npm run command, which
                        can
                        be
                        used
                        to automate common tasks such as testing and building your project.</li>

                <h3>Package</h3>
                <p>
                    The "package.json" is a configuration file in Node.js that contains information about your project
                    such as
                    its
                    name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It is used by Node.js to manage your project's
                    dependencies and to
                    execute scripts. You can use it to install dependencies required by your project with the npm
                    install
                    command and to define custom scripts with the npm run command. The package.json file also allows you
                    to
                    specify the entry point of your application, set environment variables, and define other metadata
                    related to
                    your project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we install Express in a simple project, whether it's done manually or using a command like "npm
                    i express," the package.json file will look like the example below. If done manually, we create a
                    file called package.json, initialize it as JSON by adding {} to the document, then add dependencies
                    as shown in the image below, and finally use the command "npm i".
                </p>
                <img class="img-container img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="/pages/node/images/packageDependencies.png"
                    alt="dependencies in package.json">
                <p>
                    If we have executed the "npm init" command, we will receive a package.json file that is similar to
                    the image
                    below. However, in this example, we have added a "type" field and set its value to "module".
                    When you set "type": "module" in the package.json file, you are telling Node.js to treat your
                    project as an
                    ECMAScript module. This means that you can use the import and export statements to import and export
                    code
                    between different modules in your project, instead of using the require() function that is used for
                    CommonJS
                    modules. It also enables other features such as using dynamic import() statements and setting type:
                    "module"
                    allows Node.js to interpret the file as an ECMAScript module by default.
