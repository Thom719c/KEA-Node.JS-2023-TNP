            <h3>What is npm</h3>
            <p>
                npm stands for Node Package Manager and it's a tool that comes bundled with Node.js and is used to
                manage
                third-party packages that can be used in your Node.js project.
                Node package manager is similar to Java's Maven build tool.
            </p>
            <ul class="px-5">
                <li>npm allows you to easily install, update, and remove packages from your project, as well as manage
                    their
                    dependencies.</li>
                <li>npm uses a file called package.json to store information about your project, including its
                    dependencies,
                    scripts, and metadata.</li>
                <li>npm allows you to run scripts defined in the package.json file using the npm run command, which can
                    be
                    used
                    to automate common tasks such as testing and building your project.</li>
