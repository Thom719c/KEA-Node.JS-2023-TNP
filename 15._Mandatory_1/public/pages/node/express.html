                <h3>What is Express?</h3>
                <p>
                    Express is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications
                    and APIs. It provides tools for handling HTTP requests and responses, managing routes, parsing
                    request bodies, handling cookies, and serving static files. Express is flexible, easy to use,
                    and has a large community of developers who have created many third-party modules and plugins to
                    extend its functionality. It is a popular choice for building fast, scalable, and reliable web
                    applications and APIs.

                <h3>How to run an express server</h3>
                <p>
                    Assuming that you have already installed the framework dependencies, you can include
                    it in your app.js file, which is the starting point of your server. However, if you haven't
                    installed it yet, you can see the guide on <a href="/terminalCommands#item-3">how to install
                        express</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To import it, you need to use the "require" keyword followed by "express()", which is a
                    top-level function that is exported by the express module
                    or use "import ... from ..." as shown under <a href="#item-2">Setup express</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it's completely setup we can use following command to run our express app and this command
                    is
                    assuming you at the correct directory and if you not at the right directory you have to "cd" to
                    the correct directory
                </p>
                <div>
                    <code>
                            node app.js
                        </code>
                </div>

                <p class="mt-2">
                    But with that command we have to close and run the command again if we do any changes.
                    Instead we can use nodemon and it's a tool that helps you develop Node.js applications by
                    automatically restarting the server whenever changes are made to the code.
                    To use this you have to install it and with the following command it's installed globally.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <code>npm install -g nodemon</code>
                </div>
                <p class="mt-2">The -g option tells npm to install nodemon globally, so you can use it from any
                    directory in your system.</p>

                <p>This command as shown is again assumed that you are at the correct directory.</p>
                <div>
                    <code>
                            nodemon.cmd .\app.js
                        </code>
                </div>
            </div>
