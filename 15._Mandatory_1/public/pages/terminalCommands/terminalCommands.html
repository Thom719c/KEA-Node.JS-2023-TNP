            <h3>Initializes a new Node.js package</h3>
            <p>
                npm init
                This will start a prompt that asks you a series of questions about your project, such as the project
                name, version, description, entry point, author, license, and more. You can either answer these
                questions or press enter to accept the default values.

                After you've answered all the questions, npm init will generate a package.json file in the root
                directory of your project with the metadata you've provided. You can then edit this file manually if you
                need to add or modify any of the metadata later on.
            </p>

                Overall, npm init is a useful tool that helps you get started with a new Node.js project quickly and
                easily, by creating a package.json file with the metadata you need for your project.
