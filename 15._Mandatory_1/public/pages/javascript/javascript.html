                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has three types of variables:
                </p>

                <table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Variable</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>var</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with var has function scope or global scope, depending on where
                                it
                                is declared. var variables can be re-declared and updated.<br>
                                Using var is generally not recommended in modern JavaScript development because var
                                variables have function or global scope, and can lead to issues with variable
                                hoisting
                                and unintended changes to variables.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>let</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with let has block scope, meaning that it is only accessible
                                within
                                the block it is declared in. let variables can be updated, but not re-declared in
                                the
                                same scope.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>const</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with const has block scope, and its value cannot be changed once
                                it
                                has been set.<br>
                                const variables cannot be re-assigned, which helps prevent unintended changes to
                                variables that should remain constant throughout your code. This makes it easier to
                                reason about your code and avoid bugs.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    If you know that a variable's value will never need to be changed, it's best to declare it with
                    "const". If you know that a variable will need to be re-assigned or updated, then declare it
                    with
                    "let".
                </p>
                <p>Always use "const" if you can get away with it, otherwise use "let".</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Loops</h3>
                <p>
                    As a quick example, it is generally recommended to avoid using for loops with iterators in
                    JavaScript. While this is a common practice in languages such as Java, it is not the most efficient
                    approach in JavaScript, which is a functional language. In fact, avoiding the use of built-in
                    functions and instead using for loops can often result in bad code quality and should be considered
                    a code smell. In JavaScript, it is generally better to leverage the language's functional
                    programming features and use functions like map, reduce, and filter to manipulate arrays and other
                    data structures. This not only results in more concise and readable code, but can also improve
                    performance in some cases.
                </p>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript function is a block of code that performs a specific task or returns a value. You can
                    think of it as a reusable set of instructions that you can call by name whenever you need it.

                    There are three main types of functions in JavaScript:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Named functions: These are functions that have a name and are defined using the "function" keyword.
                    They can be called by name from anywhere in your code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anonymous functions: These are functions that are not named and are defined using the "function"
                    keyword. They are typically assigned to a variable and called using that variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arrow functions: These are a shorthand syntax for defining functions that were introduced in ES6.
                    They are similar to anonymous functions but have a more concise syntax and lexically scoped "this"
                    keyword.
                </p>
                <h5>Here is the three ways of declering functions</h5>
                <p>Function</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >function myFunction(param1, param2) {
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;// Function body
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Annonymous function</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >const myFunction = function(param1, param2) {
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;// Function body
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Lambda function (also called arrowfunction)</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >const myFunction = (param1, param2) => {
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;// Function body
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h5>Callback functions</h5>
                <p>
                    A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which will be called
                    back (or executed) later. In other words, the function that receives the callback will "call back"
                    the function passed to it at a certain point during its execution. Callback functions are commonly
                    used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations like fetching data from a server, where we pass
                    a function as a callback to be executed once the data has been received. This allows us to continue
                    with other tasks until the data is ready, instead of waiting for the operation to complete.

                <h3>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>

                <h5>What is XSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of cyber attack that allows an attacker to inject malicious
                    scripts or code into a website viewed by other users. This happens when a website does not properly
                    sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject their own code that can steal user data,
                    manipulate website content, or even take over user accounts. When a user visits a website that has
                    been compromised with an XSS attack, the malicious code executes in the user's browser, potentially
                    causing harm to the user or the website. XSS attacks can be prevented by ensuring that user input is
                    properly sanitized and validating all data inputs.
                </p>

                <h5>How can you avoid XSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, when we want to set the content of an element, we can use "innerHTML". However, using
                    "innerHTML" is a bad practice as it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The "innerHTML"
                    property of an element in JavaScript allows you to set the HTML content of an element, which can be
                    a security risk. To prevent XSS attacks, it's important to sanitize user input and avoid using
                    "innerHTML" to set dynamic content directly. Instead, you can use safer methods such as "innerText" or
                    "textContent" to set the content of an element. Additionally, there are libraries available in Node.js
                    and Express that can help prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

                <h3>Code smell</h3>
                <p>
                    Code smell is a term used to describe characteristics of code that suggest the presence of
                    deeper problems. It refers to code that is difficult to maintain, hard to understand, or likely
                    to lead to errors or bugs. Identifying and addressing code smells is an important part of
                    development to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automated code analysis tools can help identify code smells in software. These tools are
                    designed to analyze code for issues such as duplicated code, overly complex code, and long
                    methods or classes. By providing feedback on code quality, these tools can help developers
                    identify areas for improvement and reduce the risk of bugs and errors. Here is two examples of
                    code analysis tools "ESLint" and "prettier".
