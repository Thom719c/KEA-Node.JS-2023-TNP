                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has three types of variables:
                </p>

                <table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Variable</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>var</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with var has function scope or global scope, depending on where
                                it
                                is declared. var variables can be re-declared and updated.<br>
                                Using var is generally not recommended in modern JavaScript development because var
                                variables have function or global scope, and can lead to issues with variable
                                hoisting
                                and unintended changes to variables.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>let</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with let has block scope, meaning that it is only accessible
                                within
                                the block it is declared in. let variables can be updated, but not re-declared in
                                the
                                same scope.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>const</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with const has block scope, and its value cannot be changed once
                                it
                                has been set.<br>
                                const variables cannot be re-assigned, which helps prevent unintended changes to
                                variables that should remain constant throughout your code. This makes it easier to
                                reason about your code and avoid bugs.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    If you know that a variable's value will never need to be changed, it's best to declare it with
                    "const". If you know that a variable will need to be re-assigned or updated, then declare it
                    with
                    "let".
                </p>
                <p>Always use "const" if you can get away with it, otherwise use "let".</p>

                <h3>Loops</h3>
                <p>
                    As a quick example, it is generally recommended to avoid using for loops with iterators in
                    JavaScript. While this is a common practice in languages such as Java, it is not the most efficient
                    approach in JavaScript, which is a functional language. In fact, avoiding the use of built-in
                    functions and instead using for loops can often result in bad code quality and should be considered
                    a code smell. In JavaScript, it is generally better to leverage the language's functional
                    programming features and use functions like map, reduce, and filter to manipulate arrays and other
                    data structures. This not only results in more concise and readable code, but can also improve
                    performance in some cases.
                </p>
                <h5>Code examples for map, filter...</h5>
                <p>
                    "map()" is used to transform each element in an array by applying a function to it and returning a
                    new
                    array with the transformed elements. It's useful when you want to create a new array based on an
                    existing array, where each element is transformed in a specific way.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >// Map method
                        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
                        const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
                        console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    "filter()" is used to create a new array containing only the elements that pass a certain condition.
                    It's useful when you want to filter out specific elements from an array based on a condition.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >// Filter method
                        const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Peter", "Thomas", "Eve"];
                        const filteredNames = names.filter((name) => name.length > 4);
                        console.log(filteredNames); // Output: ["Alice", "Peter", "Thomas"]
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    "find()" is a loop method that returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies
                    the
                    provided testing function. It's useful when you need to find the first element in an array that
                    meets some condition.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >// Find method
                        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
                        const firstEvenNumber = numbers.find(number => number % 2 === 0);
                        console.log(firstEvenNumber); // 2
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The "findIndex()" method returns the index of the first element of an array that passes a certain
                    test. It's useful when you want to find the index of a specific element in an array.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >// FindIndex method
                        const cars = [
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ brand: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2010 },
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ brand: 'Honda', model: 'Civic', year: 2015 },
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ brand: 'Ford', model: 'Mustang', year: 2020 },
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ brand: 'Chevrolet', model: 'Camaro', year: 2018 },
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ brand: 'Nissan', model: 'Altima', year: 2013 },
                        ];
                        // Find the index of the first car made by Honda
                        const hondaIndex = cars.findIndex(car => car.brand === 'Honda');
                        console.log(hondaIndex); // 1

                </pre>
                <h5>When to Use Each Method</h5>
                <p>
                    In general, you should choose the appropriate loop method based on the task at hand. If you need to
                    transform an array into a new one, use map(). If you need to filter out specific elements from an
                    array, use filter(). If you need to compute a value based on an array, use reduce(). However, it's
                    also important to consider the complexity and performance of each method, especially when working
                    with large arrays. For example, map() and filter() create new arrays, which can be memory-intensive,
                    while reduce() iterates over each element of an array, which can be slower than the other methods.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use map when you need to transform an array of values into a new array of values based on some
                        logic, while maintaining the same length of the original array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use filter when you need to select a subset of elements from an array based on a certain
                        condition. This is particularly useful when you need to filter out specific elements from an
                        array based on some logic or criteria. Filter() is an effective way to remove unwanted data from
                        an array while keeping only the elements that meet your specified conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use find when you need to find the first element in an array that meets some condition.
                        Like when you need to search for a specific element in an array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use findIndex when you need to find the index of the first element in an array that meets some
                        condition.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript function is a block of code that performs a specific task or returns a value. You can
                    think of it as a reusable set of instructions that you can call by name whenever you need it.

                    There are three main types of functions in JavaScript:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Named functions: These are functions that have a name and are defined using the "function" keyword.
                    They can be called by name from anywhere in your code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anonymous functions: These are functions that are not named and are defined using the "function"
                    keyword. They are typically assigned to a variable and called using that variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arrow functions: These are a shorthand syntax for defining functions that were introduced in ES6.
                    They are similar to anonymous functions but have a more concise syntax and lexically scoped "this"
                    keyword.
                </p>
                <h5>Here is the three ways of declering functions</h5>
                <p>Function</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"

                        }

                </pre>
                <p>Lambda function (also called arrowfunction)</p>
                <pre>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;// Function body
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h5>Callback functions</h5>
                <p>
                    A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which will be called
                    back (or executed) later. In other words, the function that receives the callback will "call back"
                    the function passed to it at a certain point during its execution. Callback functions are commonly
                    used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations like fetching data from a server, where we pass
                    a function as a callback to be executed once the data has been received. This allows us to continue
                    with other tasks until the data is ready, instead of waiting for the operation to complete.

                <h3>JavaScript Comparison Operators: "==" vs "==="</h3>
                <p>
                    "==" is a loose equality operator, which means that it will attempt to convert the operands to the
                    same type before comparison. For example, "5" == 5 would be true because the string "5" would be
                    converted to the number 5 before the comparison is made. However, this can sometimes lead to
                    unexpected results, especially when comparing values of different types.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >console.log(1 == "1"); // Output: true
                        console.log(1 == 1); // Output: true
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    "===" is a strict equality operator, which means that it compares the operands without attempting
                    any
                    type conversion. It only returns true if the operands are of the same type and have the same value.
                    For example, "5" === 5 would be false because they are of different types.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="prettyprint language-js"
                        >console.log(1 === "1"); // Output: false
                        console.log(1 === 1); // Output: true
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In general, it's a good practice to use "===" for equality comparison, as it's more precise and avoids
                    unexpected type conversions. However, there may be some cases where "==" is more appropriate, such as
                    when checking for null or undefined values.

                <h5>What is XSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of cyber attack that allows an attacker to inject malicious
                    scripts or code into a website viewed by other users. This happens when a website does not properly
                    sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject their own code that can steal user data,
                    manipulate website content, or even take over user accounts. When a user visits a website that has
                    been compromised with an XSS attack, the malicious code executes in the user's browser, potentially
                    causing harm to the user or the website. XSS attacks can be prevented by ensuring that user input is
                    properly sanitized and validating all data inputs.

                <h5>How can you avoid XSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, when we want to set the content of an element, we can use "innerHTML". However, using
                    "innerHTML" is a bad practice as it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The "innerHTML"
                    property of an element in JavaScript allows you to set the HTML content of an element, which can be
                    a security risk. To prevent XSS attacks, it's important to sanitize user input and avoid using
                    "innerHTML" to set dynamic content directly. Instead, you can use safer methods such as "innerText"
                    or
                    "textContent" to set the content of an element. Additionally, there are libraries available in
                    Node.js
                    and Express that can help prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

                <h3>Code smell</h3>
                <p>
                    Code smell is a term used to describe characteristics of code that suggest the presence of
                    deeper problems. It refers to code that is difficult to maintain, hard to understand, or likely
                    to lead to errors or bugs. Identifying and addressing code smells is an important part of
                    development to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automated code analysis tools can help identify code smells in software. These tools are
                    designed to analyze code for issues such as duplicated code, overly complex code, and long
                    methods or classes. By providing feedback on code quality, these tools can help developers
                    identify areas for improvement and reduce the risk of bugs and errors. Here is two examples of
                    code analysis tools "ESLint" and "prettier".
