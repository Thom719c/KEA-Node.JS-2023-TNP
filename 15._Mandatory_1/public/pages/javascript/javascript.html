                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has three types of variables:
                </p>

                <table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Variable</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>var</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with var has function scope or global scope, depending on where
                                it
                                is declared. var variables can be re-declared and updated.<br>
                                Using var is generally not recommended in modern JavaScript development because var
                                variables have function or global scope, and can lead to issues with variable
                                hoisting
                                and unintended changes to variables.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>let</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with let has block scope, meaning that it is only accessible
                                within
                                the block it is declared in. let variables can be updated, but not re-declared in
                                the
                                same scope.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>const</td>
                            <td>
                                A variable declared with const has block scope, and its value cannot be changed once
                                it
                                has been set.<br>
                                const variables cannot be re-assigned, which helps prevent unintended changes to
                                variables that should remain constant throughout your code. This makes it easier to
                                reason about your code and avoid bugs.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>
                    If you know that a variable's value will never need to be changed, it's best to declare it with
                    "const". If you know that a variable will need to be re-assigned or updated, then declare it
                    with
                    "let".
                </p>
                <p>Always use "const" if you can get away with it, otherwise use let.</p>

                <h3>Code smell</h3>
                <p>
                    Code smell is a term used to describe characteristics of code that suggest the presence of
                    deeper problems. It refers to code that is difficult to maintain, hard to understand, or likely
                    to lead to errors or bugs. Identifying and addressing code smells is an important part of
                    development to ensure clean, readable, and maintainable code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automated code analysis tools can help identify code smells in software. These tools are
                    designed to analyze code for issues such as duplicated code, overly complex code, and long
                    methods or classes. By providing feedback on code quality, these tools can help developers
                    identify areas for improvement and reduce the risk of bugs and errors. Here is two examples of
                    code analysis tools "ESLint" and "prettier".
